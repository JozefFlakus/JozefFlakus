### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello there! I'm a hipster ninja, Î» fan, a father and core maintainer of [Marble.js](https://marblejs.com) - a functional reactive Node.js framework for building server-side applications, based on TypeScript and RxJS.

Spread the word! If you or your company had a chance to taste Marble.js and still enjoy using it, I would be grateful backing me so I can continue maintaining, evolving and taking care of the framework's ecosystem.

Thank you for your support! See you on the Mars!
